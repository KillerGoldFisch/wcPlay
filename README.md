### What is wcPlay? ###

wcPlay (Web Cabin Play) is a node based visual scripting tool for the web! Allow users to script their own content for your application in a way that does not require them to code! Users place nodes into their script and then visually connect them together. wcPlay also comes with a built in live debugger, so users can visually inspect and change their scripts while it is running!

You can design your own scripting nodes for the user to use and even provide a server backend for user login and ajax nodes.
