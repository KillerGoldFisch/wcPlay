**wcPlay (Web Cabin Play) is a node based visual scripting tool for the web! Allow users to script their own content for your application in a way that does not require them to code! Users place nodes into their script and then visually connect them together. wcPlay also comes with a built in live debugger allowing users to visually inspect and change their scripts while it is running!**
- wcPlay is developed and maintained by **Jeff Houde** (<a href="mailto:lochemage@webcabin.org">[lochemage@webcabin.org]{@link lochemage@webcabin.org}</a>).

```

#### Node.js ####
The appropriate library files can now be installed via the Node Package Manager (npm).

```
{@lang bash}npm install --save webcabin-play
```

Once installed, all of the source files will be located in either the `bower_components` or `node_modules` folder and ready to link into your project.

### Basic Implementation ###
```
{@lang xml}<!-- Include external dependencies -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bower_components/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bower_components/wcMenu/Build/wcMenu.min.css"/>
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/FileSaver/FileSaver.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/wcUndoManager/wcUndoManager.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/wcMenu/Build/wcMenu.min.js"></script>

<!-- Include the Core wcPlay Engine -->
<script src="bower_components/wcPlay/Build/wcPlay.min.js"></script>

<!-- Include the optional set of common generic node types -->
<script src="bower_components/wcPlay/Build/wcPlayNodes.min.js"></script>

<!-- Include wcPlay editor tools -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bower_components/wcPlay/Build/wcPlayEditor.min.css"/>
<script src="bower_components/wcPlay/Build/wcPlayEditor.min.js"></script>
```
<br>

Once the proper files have been included, you can create as many instances of the {@link wcPlay} engine as you need. Each one can be loaded with their own script:
```
var myScript = new wcPlay();

var myScriptFileData = '...'; // Fill this with the string contents of a previously saved script.
myScript.load(myScriptFileData);

myScript.start();
```
By itself, the wcPlay engine has no visual component for the user to view or edit the script with. To open a wcPlay script in the editor tool, simply create an instance of the editor tool and attach it to the DOM element container where your editor will be shown:
```
var myEditor = new wcPlayEditor(domElem);
```
Once you have an editor, you will need to tie it to an instance of wcPlay so you can edit its script:
```
myEditor.engine(myScript);
```
