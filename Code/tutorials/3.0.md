Debugging is a very important aspect of developing. It allows the developer to closely inspect the actions of their script in order to ensure that it behaves correctly.

### Debug Log ###

The first method of debugging, is the console log system. By toggling debug logging on a node, any time a link or value is activated, a console message will appear in the browsers debugger. This is a useful feature as it doesn't interrupt the execution of your script, but it may become overwhelming with too many log messages.

### Breakpoint ###

The breakpoint system is where wcPlay debugging really shines. By toggling a node's breakpoint on, any time that node becomes activated in your script, your script will automatically pause execution on that node and the editor will display that node in red. From here, you can step one update at a time to follow your scripts progress one node at a time.

You can step the debugger with the <img src="img/step.jpg"/> icon on the toolbar or the `spacebar` key. Once you are finished debugging, or just want to continue running your script, press the <img src="img/play.jpg"/> icon or the `enter` key. Make sure to toggle off the breakpoint of the node unless you want it to pause again.

### Debug Stepping ###

The debug stepping process may seem a little confusing at first, but each step basically follows these rules:
- As soon as a node turns red, it has been activated, but not yet processed.
- A step of the debugger will execute the action of the node, which may change properties and activate Exit links.
- If properties are changed, those values are propagated through the property chain system until every property in that chain has processed. It is important that property values propagate first, as nodes next in the flow chain may need those values updated.
- Once all properties have been propagated, nodes activated through the flow chain will continue processing.
- Chains that split to multiple nodes, or multiple Entry links, will run in parallel to each other.
